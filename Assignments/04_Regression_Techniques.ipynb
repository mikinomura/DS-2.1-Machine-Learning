    "\n",
    "Of all the techniques in Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics, **_Regression_** is one of the most mature.  Recall that regression is different from the classification problems we have dealt with so far; whereas classification looks at data and tells us what class it belongs to, regression instead seeks to output a continuous value.  Classification and regression are often two sides of the same coin, and which one you use often depends on the phrasing of the question you're trying to answer.  For this exercise, we'll be trying to predict housing prices on the `boston_housing_prices` data set.  Let's look at an some example questions we could ask about this data set.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "* Does this house have less than 3 offers on it? *\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* Based on the price and other data about the house, can we predict if this house has 2 bedrooms, or less, or more?*\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Regression</h3>\n",
    "* How much do we think this house will sell for? *\n",

    "* Based on the data, how many offers do we expect this house to receive? *\n",

    "* Based on price and other data about the house, can we predict how many bedrooms a house has? *\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "As you can see, these are pretty much the same question, but phrased differently.  Under the hood, classification is often just a regression, with the caveat that values below the threshold are one class while values above the threshold are another.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Before we begin coding, we'll briefly explore how it works and how we can interpret a regression.  This lesson will probably feel more math-heavy than other lessons, and will certainly contain more jargon--but don't worry! The math behind linear regression is fairly intuitive (and fairly simple), and regression is great baseline for understanding how more advanced topics in machine learning work, such as Neural Networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>The Idea Behind Regression</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic form of regression is **_Linear Regression_**.  Linear Regression is a **_Linear Modeling_** technique used to predict a variable as a function of another variable. You've probably seen this written out like this before:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><h3>y = f(x)</h3></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common version of this function (and the one we're trying to discover in Linear Regression) is also one you're likely familiar with:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><h3>y = mx + b</h3></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the basic formula for a line on a cartesian plane that you likely learned in grade school.  In linear regression, our goal is to take some data: \n",

    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<center><img src='img/lbf.png' height=60% width=60%></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the line for the equation and interpret what it means.  You'll often see the the equation for the line of best fit represented like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's examine what these symbols mean, and see if we can't \n",
    "\n",
    "**_α_**: This value is the bias.  Mathematically, we can think of this as where our line crosses the y-axis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**_β_**: is the slope, which defines the relationship between x and y.  In layman's terms, we can interpret this value as how much we expect to y to increase whenever we increase the value of x by 1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we were trying to use linear regression to predict something like how much it would cost for a factory to produce \\[x\\] widgets, then we could use this equation to make a prediction. In this scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "β would represent the cost per unit to produce a widget.  How much we have to spend on manufacturing depends on how many we want ot manufacture.  If we want to manufacture 10,000 widgets and they cost us $.80 each, then the value for β would be .8.\n",
    "\n",
    "α would represent the fixed costs that don't change with the scale of x. In this scenario, these could be fixed operating costs like how much rent we have to pay to occupy the factory.  There's no avoiding this cost, and it doesn't increase or decrease with our scale.  If the rent for our factory is $10,000/month, then we know we'll have to pay $10,000 this month, regardless of whether we make 1 widget or 1 million widgets.  \n",

    "\n",
    "In the code block below, we'll create a basic data set that contains some correlation between X and Y.  Then, we'll fit a linear regression to it, and display the line of best fit. Feel free to examine the code and try to figure out how it works, but don't worry if you don't understand everything just yet--this is just help us create a quick visualization of a line of best fit against a scatterplot of data.

The whole idea of a correlation heatmap is to line up the columns of the dataset into a grid, and make it easily readable to see what correlates with what.  Each combination of columns is represented as a unique cell in the grid.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You might notice that the diagonal through the center of the grid is our key.  This makes sense, because if we plotted each at the same position on the x-axis and y-axis (for instance, CRIM would be the first column and the first row), then the box that currently says CRIM would be where we see a measure of CRIM's correlation with itself.  Since any variable's correlation with itself will always be 1, this is a nonsense column, this makes it a great place to put the variable names.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to read a correlation heatmap is to find the variable you're looking for, and realize that the both row and column extending from it all correspond to that variable.  Anything below the diagonal is going to be mirrored across the diagonal as well.  In the example above, 2 cells down from `INDUS` and 2 cells right of `INDUS` are the exact same thing--the correlation between `INDUS` and `NOX`.  Cells below the diagonal represent this information through color, whereas the cells above the diagonal just give us the actual value.  \n",
