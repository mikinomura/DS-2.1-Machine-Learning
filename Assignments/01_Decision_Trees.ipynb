    "Now that we've built a classifier by hand, we have a general intuition behind the first Machine Learning algorithm we'll be using--[Decision Tree Classifiers](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree).  **_Decision Trees_** are considered one of the more mature, traditional algorithms in predictive analytics.  Although they can also be used for regression, you'll most likely see them used for classification problems.  \n",
    "\n",

    "As explained in the SciKit-Learn user guide for this model, Decision Trees are \"a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.\" Let's explore what this means in plain English:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision Trees are **_non-parametric_**.  This means that they make no underlying assumptions about the distribution of the dataset that they are working with.  Non-parametric models are not necessarily better or worse than parametric models, just better suited for different use cases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision Trees can be used for **_Classification_** or **_Regression_**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision Trees make predictions by combining a series of simple decisions based on what it sees in the training data. These decisions are nested, to form a tree. In the last exercise, when you wrote your classifier by hand, you probably did the same thing. For instance, it's not uncommon for students to explain their handmade model by saying somnething like \"If the person I'm predicting for is a woman, I classify them as 'survived'.  If they're a man, I look at their ticket class.  If their ticket is 1st class, I predict they survived.  Otherwise, I predict they died\".  These nested sets of decisions can be represented as a tree, hence the name--Decision Tree!\n",

    "We've now gone through the steps to 'clean' our dataset, and we're almost ready to begin using our Decision Tree Classifier. Let's look at what we've done so far.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Dropped the non-numeric columns.  We can safely assume that no useful information is contained in text-based columns such as name, cabin, etc, so we've dropped them.  \n",
    "2.  Removed rows containing null values. \n",
    "3.  Used. `pd.get_dummies()` to convert categorical columns such as 'Sex' and 'Embarked' into columns for each category, with the category for the actual value containing a '1' while all other dummy columns for that category for that column will contain a '0'.\n",
    "4.  Stored the labels in a separate data set.  It is important that we do this last.  Otherwise, any changes that we make to the corresponding rows in the dataframe will not be reflected in our labels variable.  For instance, if we stored labels in a separate variable and _then_ dropped rows from the dataframe that contain null values, we would still have those corresponding labels for the passengers we've dropped from the dataframe! Separating out our labels only works if the labels for each correspond to the row at the same index in the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what we'll do next: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the appropriate tools from the `sklearn` library.  We need `train_test_split` to split our data set into training and testing sets,  the actual `DecisionTreeClassifier` model, and `f1_score` to tell us how we did.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2.  Split our data into a **_Training Set_** and a **_Testing Set_**.  Our model will 'learn' on the training set, but we don't want to use this as a metric to tell us how well our model actually does.  In order to see how well our model actually 'learned' how to make predictions, we'll split off a portion of our data to hold out as a testing set.  Our model will make predictions on this data, which gives us a better signal as to whether our model is **_overfitting_**. We'll talk about the concept of **_overfitting_** and **_underfitting_** in a later class.  \n",
    "<br> \n",
    "3.  We'll create a `DecisionTreeClassifier()` object.  \n",
    "<br> \n",
    "4.  We'll `fit()` our model by feeding in our `X_Train` and `y_train` variables.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "5.  We'll ask our classifier object to make predictions for every object in the `X_test` variable.   \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "6.  We'll use the `f1_score` object to tell us how well our model made predictions by giving it the predictions made in the last step, as well as the actual labels for those data points, which are currently stored in `y_test`.  "
