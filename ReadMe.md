# DS 2.1 Machine Learning

## Course Description

Students will learn the foundational concepts and techniques of machine learning and how to apply those techniques to data science. Principles of data science and machine learning will be examined and applied to problem solving.  Students will master data science processes and its applications, including how to wrangle and use data to train classification or prediction models. To demonstrate mastery, students will apply these techniques to develop and train models on data sets using industry-standard modern software libraries and tools. Students will develop “sharp” data science questions, select a data set and apply a variety of methods to explore those questions and find relevant answers.

### Why you should know this?

Machine learning has shaped our world. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to learn and act like humans do, and improve their learning over time in autonomous fashion, by feeding them data and information in the form of observations and real-world interactions.

## Class Assignments
- Apply Linear Regression for Boston Housing Dataset
- Apply SVM for Breast Cancer Dataset
- Projects should be linked to a project page which has a description & requirements.

### Tutorials
- We'll be exploring basic machine learning algorithms applied on to simple datasets with an emphasis on getting basic model functionality
- https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/ds-2-1-classification-tutorial

### Projects
- You will choose your own dataset to clean, investigate, and make predictions or classification or clustering on it


## Evaluation

To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Pass all required tutorials and projects (see associated rubrics)
- Pass the final summative assessment >=75%
- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
- Make up all classwork from all absences

## Attendance
 Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions: classes, huddles, etc. and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP will result in not being invited back next term.
